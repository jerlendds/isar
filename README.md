# ISAR - Illuminate Search & Retrieve
After [PhotoRec](https://github.com/cgsecurity/testdisk) file recovery tool for linux. ISAR let's you query a folder with `recup_dir` directory files by strings of your choice and can attempt to detect lost filetypes. Results can be organized by any found metadata and filetypes. 
 > “Things are never lost to you; you are lost to them. If ever in need of a Thing that has lost you, simply stop hiding from it.” 


## Motivation
While setting up a headless CMS system I generated some files in the wrong directory and went to rm them. I mistyped something and deleted all the folders on my system where I lost 60% of all code I wrote in the past year that wasn't in the cloud. Lessons have been learned, use backups and version control religiously but I'm determined to recover atleast some of my code hence the start of this tool.
