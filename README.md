# ISAR - Intelligent Search & Retrieve
After [PhotoRec](https://github.com/cgsecurity/testdisk) file recovery tool. ISAR let's you query a folder with `recup_dir` directories for strings contained in files and can attempt to rebuild the lost folder structure or return the results by filetype. Results can be organized by what folder structure can be rebuilt and also by date and or detected format. 
 > “Things are never lost to you; you are lost to them. If ever in need of a Thing that has lost you, simply stop hiding from it.” 


## Motivation
While setting up a headless CMS system I generated some files in the wrong directory and went to rm them. I mistyped something and deleted all the folders on my system where I lost 60% of all code I wrote in the past year that wasn't in the cloud. Lessons have been learned, use backups and version control religiously but I'm determined to recover atleast some of my code hence the birth of this tool. Development started on the morning of January 17, 2021.
